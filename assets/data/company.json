It was re-established, in its current form in 2009, following the acquisition and break-up of the original ABN AMRO by a banking consortium consisting of Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Santander Group and Fortis. Following the collapse of Fortis, who acquired the Dutch business, it was nationalized by the Dutch government along with Fortis Bank Nederland.\nThe bank is a product of a long history of mergers and acquisitions that date to 1765. In 1991, Algemene Bank Nederland and AMRO Bank agreed to merge to create the original ABN AMRO. By 2007, ABN AMRO was the second-largest bank in the Netherlands and the eighth-largest in Europe by assets. At that time the magazine The Banker and Fortune Global 500 placed it 15th in the list of world\u2019s biggest banks and it had operations in 63 countries, with over 110,000 employees.\nIn October 2007, a consortium of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Fortis and Banco Santander, known as RFS Holdings B.V. acquired the bank, in what was the world's biggest bank takeover to date.","image":"https:\/\/usercontent.googleapis.com\/freebase\/v1\/image\/m\/021z5y?maxwidth=150&maxheight=150&key=AIzaSyBkYwzDuYoap-Y4t6_cj3phG9RaVduJtM8","leadership":{"url":"https:\/\/www.freebase.com\/m\/03_t79","name":"Gerrit Zalm","role":"Chief Executive Officer","image":"https:\/\/usercontent.googleapis.com\/freebase\/v1\/image\/m\/03_t79?maxwidth=100&maxheight=100&key=AIzaSyBkYwzDuYoap-Y4t6_cj3phG9RaVduJtM8"}}
